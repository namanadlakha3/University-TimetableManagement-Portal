# University-TimetableManagement-Portal
The manual timetable scheduling demands considerable time and effort along with lots of paperwork. So, we propose to develop a web-based application that will be a central repository of the whole University’s management system through which students and faculties can manage their own time table. This project introduces a practical timetabling approach capable of taking care of both hard and soft constraints required specially for preparing time tables in colleges with large numbers of students and limited resources like class-rooms or labs

## Our main objectives are:

#### 1). To design a Faculty portal where the faculty can select the subject and room  according to his/her own choice of time and access their time table. A randomly generated token will be allocated to the faculties who will get early access to the portal to change their time table. The choice of room will be given according to the strength of the students who will be studying the subject. The faculties will be able to enter all the details considering the number of credits of each subject. 
#### 2). To design a Student Portal where the students can select the faculty they want to study the subject from. The students will be selecting the faculties for their pre-defined subjects. The time and day already decided by the faculty will be reflected in their final time-table.
#### 3). To design an algorithm which can schedule the time table on the basis of requests made by students and teachers with no clashing issues.
